# Search-Engine-Web-Application

## Agenda

Hosting a web application (Search-Engine) using AWS services, GIT service and customized Web page.

# Deployment of Search-Engine Web Application using AWS

Created and configured a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnets to securely launch EC2 instances, along with an Internet Gateway to route the web application traffic to the Internet, ensuring seamless user access.

Deployed and enabled the Apache2 web server on the EC2 instance to host the application, ensuring it was accessible and performant.

Utilized AWS Route 53 to create and manage DNS records, associating the public IP of the EC2 instance with the DNS, thereby allowing users to access the web application through a custom domain.

Implemented security groups and network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic, enhancing the security of the hosted web application.

Configured CloudWatch for monitoring and logging, setting up alarms to track application performance and ensure high availability.
