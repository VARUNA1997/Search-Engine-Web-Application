# Search-Engine-Web-Application

## Agenda

Hosting a web application (Search-Engine) using AWS services, GIT service and customized Web page.

# Deployment of Search-Engine Web Application using AWS

> Created and configured a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnets to securely launch EC2 instances, along with an Internet Gateway to route the web application traffic to the Internet, ensuring seamless user access.

> Deployed and enabled the Apache2 web server on the EC2 instance to host the application, ensuring it was accessible and performant.

> Utilized AWS Route 53 to create and manage DNS records, associating the public IP of the EC2 instance with the DNS, thereby allowing users to access the web application through a custom domain.

> Implemented security groups and network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic, enhancing the security of the hosted web application.

> Configured CloudWatch for monitoring and logging, setting up alarms to track application performance and ensure high availability.
